Students in Arizona State University's Barrett Honors College earn Honors Credit by going beyond the typical contents of a course and doing an extra, related project.
For some of our courses, we offer students an opportunity to earn honors credit by creating a module teaching the world about a specific topic not otherwise covered on pwn.college.
These modules are collected here for your enjoyment and learning!

The repository for this dojo is at [https://github.com/pwncollege/honors-dojo](https://github.com/pwncollege/honors-dojo).
