# CSE 365 (and others?) honors contracts

CSE 365 offers honors contracts!
Honors students must create a custom pwn.college module on a computing topic of their choice.
There should be 4-10 challenges progressively teaching the concept, as well as either accompanying text or lecture videos (at least 10 minutes per challenge) to help explain ideas.
Interested should contact the instructors over email.

The dojo is deployed at: https://pwn.college/honors-dojo~ef9ed69f/
